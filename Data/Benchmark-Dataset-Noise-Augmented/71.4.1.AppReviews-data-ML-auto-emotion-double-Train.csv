pages don't fill the screen well  with the latest update i'm now able to sign into the app on my galaxy s4  and it's considerably more stable and responsive on my nook hd+  but unfortunately now when i try to read comics the pages only take up about 2/3 of the screen's available real estate with black borders on the left  right  and bottom.  even if i pinch zoom to fill the screen  when i move to the next page it goes back to the original size.  hopefully they can address that issue and then start adding some of the other standard features of comic readers.  update 8/26/13: today's update still doesn't resolve the issue with comics rendering in about 2/3 of the screen.  while i'm happy to see that they've doubled the number of issues you can have offline  the first time i tried to open one the app crashed back to the launcher.  all in all  this app is still completely unusable on android imo.,-1,Negative,1,Validate,I am so lucky to have you in my corner.,0,pages don't fill the screen well  with the latest update i'm now able to sign into the app on my galaxy s4  and it's considerably more stable and responsive on my nook hd+  but unfortunately now when i try to read comics the pages only take up about 2/3 of the screen's available real estate with black borders on the left  right  and bottom.  even if i pinch zoom to fill the screen  when i move to the next page it goes back to the original size.  hopefully they can address that issue and then start adding some of the other standard features of comic readers.  update 8/26/13: today's update still doesn't resolve the issue with comics rendering in about 2/3 of the screen.  while i'm happy to see that they've doubled the number of issues you can have offline  the first time i tried to open one the app crashed back to the launcher.  all in all  this app is still completely unusable on android imo.

pages don't fill the screen well  with the latest update i'm now able to sign into the app on my galaxy s4  and it's considerably more stable and responsive on my nook hd+  but unfortunately now when i try to read comics the pages only take up about 2/3 of the screen's available real estate with black borders on the left  right  and bottom.  even if i pinch zoom to fill the screen  when i move to the next page it goes back to the original size.  hopefully they can address that issue and then start adding some of the other standard features of comic readers.  update 8/26/13: today's update still doesn't resolve the issue with comics rendering in about 2/3 of the screen.  while i'm happy to see that they've doubled the number of issues you can have offline  the first time i tried to open one the app crashed back to the launcher.  all in all  this app is still completely unusable on android imo.,-1,Negative,1,Validate,I'm afraid I can't agree with that.,1,pages don't fill the screen well  with the latest update i'm now able to sign into the app on my galaxy s4  and it's considerably more stable and responsive on my nook hd+  but unfortunately now when i try to read comics the pages only take up about 2/3 of the screen's available real estate with black borders on the left  right  and bottom.  even if i pinch zoom to fill the screen  when i move to the next page it goes back to the original size.  hopefully they can address that issue and then start adding some of the other standard features of comic readers.  update 8/26/13: today's update still doesn't resolve the issue with comics rendering in about 2/3 of the screen.  while i'm happy to see that they've doubled the number of issues you can have offline  the first time i tried to open one the app crashed back to the launcher.  all in all  this app is still completely unusable on android imo.

suggestions  comprehensive an incredibly solid start. there are some quirks and bugs (that aren't suuuper major) and an overall lack of features  but the base here is startlingly fresh and good. the lack of gesture support and more icon customization  as well as a way to hide the settings page (tucking it away in a gesture  overflow menu somewhere  or separate app shortcut) make it difficult to leave nova launcher. here are my suggestions  and what it would take to make me switch:  - customize app icons on long-press  individually. applying a theme is great  but they rarely cover 100% of all apps  and the inconsistency drives me mad.  - gesture support. i love being able to swipe down anywhere and pulling down my notification shade  or swiping up for my app drawer  etc.  - customization of panels. i'd like to be able to decide if i want a full apps list  or the launcher settings  and be able to decide where they are located.  i have already purchased the pro key  so i'm excited to see if these features get implemented. i currently run a custom setup i made for myself in nova launcher mimicking the google now aesthetic  but having it in launcher form would be 10x better. good luck!,0,Neutral,2,Test,Your positivity and optimism inspire me to see the good in everything.,0,suggestions  comprehensive an incredibly solid start. there are some quirks and bugs (that aren't suuuper major) and an overall lack of features  but the base here is startlingly fresh and good. the lack of gesture support and more icon customization  as well as a way to hide the settings page (tucking it away in a gesture  overflow menu somewhere  or separate app shortcut) make it difficult to leave nova launcher. here are my suggestions  and what it would take to make me switch:  - customize app icons on long-press  individually. applying a theme is great  but they rarely cover 100% of all apps  and the inconsistency drives me mad.  - gesture support. i love being able to swipe down anywhere and pulling down my notification shade  or swiping up for my app drawer  etc.  - customization of panels. i'd like to be able to decide if i want a full apps list  or the launcher settings  and be able to decide where they are located.  i have already purchased the pro key  so i'm excited to see if these features get implemented. i currently run a custom setup i made for myself in nova launcher mimicking the google now aesthetic  but having it in launcher form would be 10x better. good luck!

suggestions  comprehensive an incredibly solid start. there are some quirks and bugs (that aren't suuuper major) and an overall lack of features  but the base here is startlingly fresh and good. the lack of gesture support and more icon customization  as well as a way to hide the settings page (tucking it away in a gesture  overflow menu somewhere  or separate app shortcut) make it difficult to leave nova launcher. here are my suggestions  and what it would take to make me switch:  - customize app icons on long-press  individually. applying a theme is great  but they rarely cover 100% of all apps  and the inconsistency drives me mad.  - gesture support. i love being able to swipe down anywhere and pulling down my notification shade  or swiping up for my app drawer  etc.  - customization of panels. i'd like to be able to decide if i want a full apps list  or the launcher settings  and be able to decide where they are located.  i have already purchased the pro key  so i'm excited to see if these features get implemented. i currently run a custom setup i made for myself in nova launcher mimicking the google now aesthetic  but having it in launcher form would be 10x better. good luck!,0,Neutral,2,Test,"I'm sorry, but I think you're completely off base.",1,suggestions  comprehensive an incredibly solid start. there are some quirks and bugs (that aren't suuuper major) and an overall lack of features  but the base here is startlingly fresh and good. the lack of gesture support and more icon customization  as well as a way to hide the settings page (tucking it away in a gesture  overflow menu somewhere  or separate app shortcut) make it difficult to leave nova launcher. here are my suggestions  and what it would take to make me switch:  - customize app icons on long-press  individually. applying a theme is great  but they rarely cover 100% of all apps  and the inconsistency drives me mad.  - gesture support. i love being able to swipe down anywhere and pulling down my notification shade  or swiping up for my app drawer  etc.  - customization of panels. i'd like to be able to decide if i want a full apps list  or the launcher settings  and be able to decide where they are located.  i have already purchased the pro key  so i'm excited to see if these features get implemented. i currently run a custom setup i made for myself in nova launcher mimicking the google now aesthetic  but having it in launcher form would be 10x better. good luck!
